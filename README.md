# Kepler â€“ Public Website

> This repo houses the code for the [public homepage](https://getkepler.live) of Kepler.

The waitlist form is powered by Tally.so, and the database lives within Notion.

Previously, the website was a Notion page that was hosted via Super.so, but this was changed to avoid paying unnecessary fees.
